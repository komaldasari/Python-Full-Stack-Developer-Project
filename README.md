# Python-Full-Stack-Developer-Project
This project is a **Banking Management System** developed using **Python with Flask** as the backend framework. It allows users to **register, log in, and access banking-related pages**, such as a homepage, banking dashboard, and additional service pages. The application features **form validation using JavaScript** and a structured frontend built with **HTML and CSS**. The backend, written in Python (`webapp.py`, `main.py`), handles page routing and connects templates to user actions. While the system offers a working interface for basic banking functions, it currently lacks database integration and session handling, indicating it is a **prototype or academic-level full stack project** focused on demonstrating user interaction and navigation within a banking context.
